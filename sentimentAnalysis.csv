9,MGPT80,"There isn't much else to say; Joker is one of the most absorbing, powerful films ever made. The cinematography is remarkable and the score is just perfectly potent and understated. This is not a thrill-a-minute movie designed to keep you entertained throughout. It is a heavy, all-consuming character study that invites you, with reluctance and fascination, into the mind of a severely disturbed outcast. I don't remember any movie leaving me feeling so emotionally disoriented as I left the cinema.

The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is something very special indeed. We spend nearly the full two hours just watching him close up and every second is exhilarating. Rarely, if ever, has a character been so utterly captivating, so desperate and so tragic. His physical acting, from writhing in anguish to dancing with warped delight, is utterly mesmerising. And not once did he ever lay it on too thick. To portray that level of pain and fury without indulging in excess morbidity or melodrama is quite an achievement.

Forget where this masterpiece fits into the world of DC comics and Batman movies; Joker is a stand-alone film that deservedly takes its place amongst the greats.",there isnt much else say joker one absorbing powerful films ever made the cinematography remarkable score perfectly potent understated this thrillaminute movie designed keep entertained throughout it heavy allconsuming character study invites reluctance fascination mind severely disturbed outcast i dont remember movie leaving feeling emotionally disoriented i left cinemathe performance joaquin phoenix something special indeed we spend nearly full two hours watching close every second exhilarating rarely ever character utterly captivating desperate tragic his physical acting writhing anguish dancing warped delight utterly mesmerising and ever lay thick to portray level pain fury without indulging excess morbidity melodrama quite achievementforget masterpiece fits world dc comics batman movies joker standalone film deservedly takes place amongst greats,positive

16,thetyvonlesure,"Joker is a contemporary example of a chef-d'oeuvre. It's a monumental piece of art. In essence, it's a masterpiece. Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix in a once in a lifetime portrayal of an iconic comic book villain. Barring any connection to the source material, Joker stands on its own as a film that will be upheld in the annals of the decade's best films.

Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a mentally unstable man who is trying to find his place in a society that rejects him. Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur is perfection. Phoenix captures the essence of life with mental illness. In a career with so many masterful character portrayals, this is the one that viewers will cite as Phoenix's crown jewel. The emotion within the film supersedes great acting by taking a step into reality. Arthur Fleck is a character that is written so well and so real that it hurts. Where much of the media stigmatizes mental illness, the character of Arthur Fleck humanizes it.

The cinematography in this movie is incredible. 2019 has been a year of great camera work, and this film spearheads the year. There are many iconic scenes layered throughout the film that are phenomenally shot. As the movie progresses, the film grows exceptionally in terms of cinematography. At times it is hard to tell whether the movie was shot digitally or on film. Essentially, this movie bridges the gaps between new wave cinema and contemporary cinema in a graceful manner. The lighting used within the film is atmospheric and successfully matches Arthur's mood throughout the film. The cinematography is masterful.

This film is a Dramatic, Psychological Thriller with a great twist. The writing is insanely clever. The suspense is uncanny. The ending is satisfying and chilling. The supporting cast are great. They add weight to Arthur's emotion, successfully building him up and progressing his development. The soundtrack is iconic. The music enhances the overall experience as opposed to watering it down with noise. This film is damn near perfection. Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix created a modern masterpiece

Overall, Joker is a classic in the making. It challenges the stigma surrounding mental illness, presenting a narrative coupled with classism. This movie is important. In a zeitgeist where mental instability is a common issue, this film gives voice to the voiceless.",joker contemporary example chefdoeuvre its monumental piece art in essence masterpiece joker stars joaquin phoenix lifetime portrayal iconic comic book villain barring connection source material joker stands film upheld annals decades best filmsjoker stars joaquin phoenix arthur fleck mentally unstable man trying find place society rejects phoenixs portrayal arthur perfection phoenix captures essence life mental illness in career many masterful character portrayals one viewers cite phoenixs crown jewel the emotion within film supersedes great acting taking step reality arthur fleck character written well real hurts where much media stigmatizes mental illness character arthur fleck humanizes itthe cinematography movie incredible year great camera work film spearheads year there many iconic scenes layered throughout film phenomenally shot as movie progresses film grows exceptionally terms cinematography at times hard tell whether movie shot digitally film essentially movie bridges gaps new wave cinema contemporary cinema graceful manner the lighting used within film atmospheric successfully matches arthurs mood throughout film the cinematography masterfulthis film dramatic psychological thriller great twist the writing insanely clever the suspense uncanny the ending satisfying chilling the supporting cast great they add weight arthurs emotion successfully building progressing development the soundtrack iconic the music enhances overall experience opposed watering noise this film damn near perfection todd philips joaquin phoenix created modern masterpieceoverall joker classic making it challenges stigma surrounding mental illness presenting narrative coupled classism this movie important in zeitgeist mental instability common issue film gives voice voiceless,positive

I went into the movie with very high expectations, and may I say those expectations have been exceeded.

I left the movie theater in a state of shock, not completely comprehending the beauty I just saw. Another thing which was done so beautifully in this movie was the way that it strayed away from the DCU and comic book movies as a whole.

In terms of movie, Joker origin story is something very new and very much needed. It has always been emphasized in the DC world that Gotham was irredeemable, that the people were so corrupted that the city was beyond saving. But the reason behind it was never shown. The story has always been told from Batman's point of view. This storytelling is so brilliant, you really sympathize and understand why Joker is what it is. If you see Dark Knight just after this, Joker's love for chaos will make total sense.

It's good to see such a realistic cinema with characters having so much depth. The level of acting and movie making is legendary. Hats off!

34,blanbrn,"Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the ""Clown Prince of Crime"" as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only ""Joker"". And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's ""Joker"" was like that of the late 70's early 80's ""Joker"" in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.

Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a ""Golden Globe"" or ""Oscar"") a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.

However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.

Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to ""The Dark Knight"". Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.

Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates ""The Joker""(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!)

It's almost a documentary about the very real illness that MANY of us face but are too scared to reveal until breaking point. The addition of the Joker, well, that's just a bonus.

This is a movie that every one will relate to, we all have a dark side, we all have felt or are lonely, and we do find society absurd though we conform.

It is truly what a movie should be: transporting you in the psyche of someone that is not you and make you relate to this person in some strange way. I'm speechless by how incredible it was, how I was taken by surprise... We knew Phoenix to be a great actor for twisted vilain since Gladiator , but now it is going to be impossible to imagine the Joker without him playing it. There is such depth in his acting, such a raw interpretation of mental illness. I'm just baffled how he is able to carry the movie and this level of intensity from the first minute to the last one on -almost- a stand alone performance. Very impressive performance that make some A list actors look like amateur who can only play themselves. As an origin story for the joker, it brings so much depth to this DC character and thinking of the Joker now in previous Batman movie, make him become such an interesting vilain.

As a final note, I loved how they twisted the birth of Batman and kept the previous work done with Batman begins coherent but slightly different.

I thought before that DC was doing a poor job transposing their universe and character to the big screen (except for Batman Begins) but man, this movie changed my mind!

45,mahdiy-89469,"Joker is a masterpiece unlike any CBM(comic book movie) that has come before it.

It touches on topics that are extremely relevant in today's society such as mental health, modern-day crime and corruption, and moral bankruptcy through the journey of the main character, Arthur Fleck. He is a man with high hopes and dreams at the beginning of the film who struggles to make things work for himself due to his mental instability and inability to fit in. All the unfortunate events that take place transform Arthur into the infamous big bad of Gotham we all know, the Joker.

Joaquin Phoenix absolutely kills it in this movie. His poignant performance gave the movie what it needed in telling its dark and gritty story and is arguably the best Joker performance ever.

The movie isn't that original, isn't something that you haven't seen before, but it's original in its purpose and vision. Todd, Joaquin and the whole working team had made one of the most iconic movies of all time portraying a different and original version of the Joker we all know but he's a metal ill, twisted and a suffering man that tries to be loved, understood, he wants his tears to be dried and he wants to be one of us, but he can't, he knows he can't and for that he'll become something else, choosing a path that himself seems to not accept. Joker earns 10 stars from me, not only because it's a magnificent movie, but because it's easily recognisable and it will stuck in your minds as most of icons movies from the past has done with your mind.

I saw one review where s/he literally wrote that s/he wanted to see a villain killing for no reason. Is that how a story works? If someone is a psycho. There has to be some reason and proper explanation about what he is doing or why he is doing. Killing people without any reason doesnt bring any character arc to the character. I think Phoenix nailed it as the Joker. His acting was perfect. If we talk about Cinematography, then its pretty notched up. The violence and action in this movie isnt high like any other superhero movie. But I think thats what make this movie more realistic and relatable to the real world. I am a die hard marvel fan, and I loved this movie. Music score is top notched, you would have heard it in the teaser trailer. His laughs really shows someone with suffering nd pain.

62,zahamako,"At first I was hesitant to watch this film, mainly because of DC's past movies like Suicide Squad, Batman V Superman, Justice League, etc. But this is a more realistic take on one of the most iconic super villains of all time. Joker is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography is spectacular and I never thought I would see another movie that looked as stunning as this. Joaquin Phoenix's performance in my opinion is better than Heath Ledgers. The movie is presented in a dream-like manor, moments where scenes are just fantasies in Arthur's head which makes it ambiguous and up for interpretation. The final 15 minutes is absolutely phenomenal and I left the movie theater with a smile, highly satisfied with what I saw. Film buffs would appreciate this movie more due to it's themes and Martin Scorsese-like-style.

75,Manveer_Mathur,"It was pretty clear from before the movie got released that despite being a central comic book villain, Joker would not be anywhere along the lines of any superhero/super villain film we've ever seen. Instead of having the clown of Gotham going on a mad rampage to burn down the city, we witness an origin story for Joker : a story of how a normal if not slightly delusional person on being bogged down by society can turn into an uncontrollable, cold-blooded madman that we all know of.

Joker's alter ego Arthur Fleck's struggles makes it immensely relatable and it is amazing to watch the character develop throughout the film. Joaquin Phoenix never fails, delivering a strong performance and proving that he is one of the best, most devoted method actors in the industry.

Joker rides on a simple plot fueled by a cast of extraordinary actors and a spine-chilling soundtrack which goes perfect with the protagonist's actions. With a couple of gory scenes, the movie can feel a bit heavy to handle.

This is not the origin story of any joker you have seen before. This is a very different take, and dare I say more realistic dissection of a villain we have all loved and hated for over a decade.

This movie is brilliant, thrilling, sad and a beautiful dark masterpiece. A spectacular character study with an unbelivebale and outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix, this is by far the best performance in last 10 years, the way he laughs, his body language, his eyes, his facial expressions are all out of this world, Joaquin conveys all types of emotions in a sensational way. The story is well paced and takes us step by step with arther and his fall from sanity to insanity each action and each detail matters and affects the coming events and makes us as audience understand to some degree the horrible actions that arther will do in the future. This movie accuses us the society and puts the blame on us for the way we treat ourselves and how we create within us monsters. The Joker that we get in the end is a moving representation of the corruption in our society and especially our media wich explains why there is a group of ""critcs"" that are demonizing The movie and ignoring the art in it and the big message it carries.
